# Doran's Guide

**Website: [heroickatora.github.io/DoransGuide/]**

## Description

Doran's guide is a complete guide to item usage as well as a comparison for it 
between different data sets (more on this later). It parses thousands of games
and extracts the item related data from them to create very detailed and 
extensive statistics about their power.

These statistics are then visualized on a web page on which the viewer can also
choose to compare statistics based on one key value. Game data is sorted by
* Version
* Region
* Map
* Queue type
* Participant's rating
* Champion
* Item

But most importantly, instead of just giving the win rate or rate of item usage,
Doran's guide actually shows how these two key values depend on the time and
gold difference at the moment of purchase. This enables players to make more
sophisticated choices about when to buy which item. 

## Documentation

When using the scripts, you will most likely want to set the working directory
as src, since the scripts generate their data into ../data.
Also, every script that uses the Riot Api needs to be given a argument
> -k <api-key>
to work properly. Otherwise, it will exit when trying to access the api.

### gameanalyser.py

This python script uses the data generated by gamedownloader.py to generate the
analytical files that contain all data about item usage. Each file follows the
following rules:
* It is located in data/analysis/<region>/<patch>/<mapId>
* Its name is <queue type>.<ranking>.json
* Inside is a map in json format. Keys are string of the format
  
  <region>/<patch>/<mapId>/<queue type>/<ranking>/<championId>/<itemId>/<role>/<lane>
  
  For each of these parts, the values given by the Riot Games api as well as 
  the special key 
  > ANY
  are valid.
* The values of the map are json object with the four properties
  * timeAndGoldTable
  * timeTable
  * goldTable
  * winStatistic
  
  The first three contain a list, the last one a single instance of a WinStatistic,
  a list with exactly two entries, the first one being the number of games played,
  the second one the number of games won. timeAndGoldTable is the flat representation
  of a two dimensional map [timeInterval][goldDifference].


## Planned
Switching to a database and a web server would give the freedom to index the
game data by a few more key parameters, e.g. the role and lane of the player.
